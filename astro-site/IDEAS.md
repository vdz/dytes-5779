# Features & Ideas for dytes-astro (TES Study)

This document tracks potential features and enhancements for the Talmud Eser Hasefirot (TES) daily learning platform.

## 1. Interactive Glossary & Terminology (Hover)
- **Concept**: Hover over kabbalistic terms (e.g., *Sefirot*, *Partzufim*) for instant definitions.
- **Benefit**: Helps maintain study flow without needing external dictionaries.

## 2. Personal Learning Dashboard
- **Progress Tracking**: "Mark as Completed" for pages/sections.
- **Visual Mapping**: A visual map (e.g., Tree of Life structure) that fills in as you progress.
- **Gamification**: Daily streaks to encourage consistency.

## 3. Multimedia Integration
- **Audio/Video Lessons**: Embed recordings directly next to the relevant text.
- **Timestamp Sync**: Clicking a video timestamp scrolls the text to the corresponding paragraph.

## 4. Smart Cross-Referencing
- **Split Pane View**: Open referenced sources (Zohar, Eitz Chaim) in a side panel without losing place in the current text.

## 5. Spiritual "Flashcards" & Quizzes
- **Memory Aids**: Interactive flashcards based on the "Questions and Answers for the Meaning of Terms" section at the end of each Part (*Helek*).

## 6. Annotations & Community
- **Private Notes**: Highlight text and leave personal study notes.
- **Shared Insights**: Optional layer to see common questions or explanations from other students on specific paragraphs.

## 7. Advanced Spiritual Search
- **Contextual Search**: Filter by specific Parts or spiritual concepts (e.g., *Ohr Makif* vs. *Ohr Pnimi*).

## 8. Focused Study Mode
- **Aesthetics**: "Candlelight" or "Parchment" themes.
- **Minimalism**: Hide all navigation and UI elements to focus entirely on the text.

## 9. Offline / Print Support
- **Daily Leaf**: Generate a clean, printable PDF version of the day's study portion for screen-free learning.
